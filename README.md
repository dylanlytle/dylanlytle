## Intro

Hi,

I am Dylan Lytle.  I am a firmware engineer in the Salt Lake City, Utah area.  I graduated from the University of Utah with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering in 2016.  Most of my experience is in C, C++ and Python but I enjoy learning and experimenting with other languages.
